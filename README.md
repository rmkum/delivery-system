# üöö Delivery Security System

A comprehensive full-stack delivery parcel security system with smart locker controllers, mobile applications, and backend services designed to solve parcel theft in restaurants through 80% theft reduction.

## üéØ Project Overview

This system provides secure parcel delivery through smart lockable shelves with the following key features:

- **Smart Locker Controllers**: ESP32-based controllers with solenoid locks and sensors
- **Secure Authentication**: JWT tokens, device certificates, and magic link authentication
- **Mobile Applications**: React Native apps for delivery riders and restaurant staff
- **Admin Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring and analytics web interface
- **Backend API**: Node.js/TypeScript with comprehensive audit logging
- **Device Communication**: MQTT protocol for real-time device management

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Backend Services (`/backend`)
- **Auth Service**: Rider authentication, staff login, JWT token management
- **Order Orchestrator**: Smart slot assignment, unlock token generation
- **Event Ledger**: Immutable audit logs for all unlock attempts
- **Device API**: Secure MQTT/HTTPS communication with shelf controllers

### Mobile Applications (`/mobile`)
- **Rider App**: QR scanning, OTP fallback, unlock requests
- **Staff App**: Slot assignment, dashboard, manual overrides
- React Native cross-platform with offline support

### Device Firmware (`/firmware`)
- **ESP32 Controllers**: JWT verification, actuator control, sensor monitoring
- **Security Features**: Client certificates, tamper detection, fail-secure locks
- **Communication**: MQTT over TLS with backend services

### Web Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
- **Admin Interface**: Real-time occupancy monitoring
- **Analytics**: Success rates, error tracking, security alerts
- **Management**: Device provisioning, user administration

### Infrastructure (`/infrastructure`)
- **Development**: Docker Compose environment
- **Production**: Kubernetes deployment manifests
- **Security**: Certificate authority, monitoring, alerting

## üîê Security Features

- ‚úÖ **Single-use JWT tokens** with 60-second TTL
- ‚úÖ **Device mutual TLS** authentication
- ‚úÖ **Tamper detection** with automatic lockout
- ‚úÖ **Rate limiting** and abuse prevention
- ‚úÖ **End-to-end audit logging**
- ‚úÖ **Secure OTA firmware** updates

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm 9+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- React Native development environment
- Arduino IDE or PlatformIO for firmware

### Installation

```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm run install:all

# Start development environment
npm run dev

# Build all components
npm run build
```

### Development Environment

```bash
# Start backend and dashboard
npm run dev

# Mobile development (separate terminal)
cd mobile
npm run android  # or npm run ios
```

## üì± Mobile Apps

### Rider App Features
- QR code scanning for parcel pickup
- OTP fallback for poor lighting/offline scenarios
- Visual guidance with LED slot indicators
- Offline token caching (60s)
- Push notifications for order updates

### Staff App Features
- Quick slot assignment via bag QR scan
- Real-time dashboard of occupied slots
- Manual override with MFA authentication
- Audit log access

## üîß Hardware Requirements

### Smart Shelf Controller
- **Controller**: ESP32 with secure storage
- **Locks**: Solenoid latches (fail-secure, 50N+ holding force)
- **Sensors**: Reed switches (door), optional load cells
- **Indicators**: Tri-color LEDs per slot
- **Power**: PoE preferred, 12-24V backup
- **Connectivity**: Ethernet primary, Wi-Fi fallback

### Installation
- Retrofit existing shelf units (4-12 cubbies)
- Tamper-proof enclosure with service access
- Certificate provisioning during installation

## üìä Performance Targets

- **Unlock Time**: < 2 seconds from valid request
- **QR Scan Success**: ‚â• 95% first attempt
- **Rider Pickup**: < 15 seconds median
- **Staff Assignment**: < 10 seconds
- **Parcel Loss Reduction**: ‚â• 80% within 3 months

## üîç Monitoring & Analytics

### Real-time Metrics
- Slot occupancy percentage
- Unlock success/failure rates
- Device health and connectivity
- Security events and alerts

### Audit & Compliance
- Immutable event ledger
- 90-day retention policy
- Compliance reporting
- Incident response workflows
